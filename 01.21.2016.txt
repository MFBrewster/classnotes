MODELING REAL WORLD ENTITIES
  1. Abstraction and Modeling
    - the world is complex, many things are complex
    - instead of dealing with the raw complexity of all of the information in
      the world, instead we ABSTRACT that information in order to simplify it
      and make it easier to work with

  2. How Abstraction and Modeling Helps Developers
    - Simplify data in order to make it more clear and readable
    - writing efficient code which abstracts repeated code out into functions
    - considering problems in the abstract, in English, before writing code

  3. The way you abstract complex information will depend upon the problem
     you're trying to solve
     - context is important

  4. Modeling in Javascript
     - Models can be as simple as a single number (weather abstracted to temp),
       or are often abstracted into arrays
       > lists of similar items, indexes enough to distinguish them

IMPLEMENT THESE MODELS WITH OBJECTS
     - However, most often, the thing modeled has multiple attributes
       > Therefor, OBJECTS ARE USUALLY THE BEST CHOICE FOR MODELING REAL
         WORLD ATTRIBUTES
     - In addition to normal data types, OBJECTS CAN HAVE FUNCTIONS AS PROPERTIES
       > Having a function as the property of an object is called a 'method'
       > This is great... you can write your own methods into objects. I'm amazed.

See practicejs.js and recipe.js for examples of modeling real-life stuff

# THIS
From within a method, referencing properties of the same object

1. Self-referential objects
  - When you're coding within an object, you can refer to the object using the `this` keyword
  - the idea of object-oriented programming is to encapsulate data and behavior,
    and `this` gives us a way to refer to that data within an object
    -

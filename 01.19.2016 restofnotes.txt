#GIT AND GITHUB
Git work flow:
  1. initialize git repo
  2. create branch and do work on that branch (making changes)
  3. stage changes (and take notes)
  4. commit changes

  staging and committing: staging is important because you want to be able to separate the things which are ready to commit
  from the things which are not ready yet

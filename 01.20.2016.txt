#JAVASCRIPT REFERENCE TYPES

Identify array, object, and function literals
  1. DICTIONARY -
    > An object
    > A collection
    > An associative array (?)
    > distinct (but analogous) from real-life word-definition dictionary
  2. LIST
    > Also a collection
    > An array
  3. FUNCTION
    > Encapsulated executable code
  4. EXAMPLES
    > dictionary = {};
    > list = [];
    > func = function(){};
  5. EACH REFERENCE HOLDS/STORES VALUES
    > access functions using invocation syntax: func()
    > access array using index syntax: list[0]
    > access objects using member syntax: dictionary.name or dictionary['name']
  6. REFERENCES ARE DISTINCT FROM PRIMITIVES
    > References -on their own- do not have values, they only point ('refer') to something else

Create and invoke functions with argument-dependent return values
  1. Functions store code which may be invoked throughout a program
  2. Allows you to take code which might be used many time, and only write it once
  3. PARAMETERS are the names you use when you define a function
  4. ARGUMENTS are the variables/values which you pass into the functions

Store, access, and update data values in objects and arrays
  1. Collections come in two types: arrays and objects
  2. arrays store list of things
  3. objects store dictionaries, ie strings which are associated with definitions or values

Iterate through an array or object and operate on its elements
